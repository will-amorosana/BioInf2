Acts as a coactivator for CREB-mediated transcription, steroid receptor-mediated transcription, and Notch-mediated transcription; Belongs to the SNF2/RAD54 helicase family. SWR1 subfamily"
53,MCL,1,Red,61,SUV420H1,9606.ENSP00000305899,"Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase KMT5B; Histone methyltransferase that specifically trimethylates 'Lys-20' of histone H4. H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional repression. Mainly functions in pericentric heterochromatin regions, thereby playing a central role in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin in these regions. KMT5B is targeted to histone H3 via its interaction with RB1 family proteins (RB1, RBL1 and RBL2) (By similarity). Plays a role in myogenesis by regulating the expression of target genes, such as EID3"
54,MCL,1,Red,61,TAF1,9606.ENSP00000406549,Transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit 1; Largest component and core scaffold of the TFIID basal transcription factor complex. Contains novel N- and C-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domains which can autophosphorylate or transphosphorylate other transcription factors. Phosphorylates TP53 on 'Thr-55' which leads to MDM2- mediated degradation of TP53. Phosphorylates GTF2A1 and GTF2F1 on Ser residues. Possesses DNA-binding activity. Essential for progression of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Exhibits histone acetyltransferase activity towards histones H3 and H4; Belongs to the TAF1 family
55,MCL,1,Red,61,TAF1C,9606.ENSP00000455265,"TATA box-binding protein-associated factor RNA polymerase I subunit C; Component of the transcription factor SL1/TIF-IB complex, which is involved in the assembly of the PIC (preinitiation complex) during RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription. The rate of PIC formation probably is primarily dependent on the rate of association of SL1/TIF-IB with the rDNA promoter. SL1/TIF-IB is involved in stabilization of nucleolar transcription factor 1/UBTF on rDNA. Formation of SL1/TIF-IB excludes the association of TBP with TFIID subunits. Recruits RNA polymerase I to the rRNA gene promoter via [...] "

Plays an essential role in transcription activation mediated by nuclear receptors. Probably acts as integral component of corepressor complexes that mediates the recruitment of the 19S proteasome complex, leading to the subsequent proteasomal degradation of transcription repressor complexes, thereby allowing cofactor exchange; WD repeat domain containing"

Plays an essential role in transcription activation mediated by nuclear receptors. Probably acts as integral component of the N-Cor corepressor complex that mediates the recruitment of the 19S proteasome complex, leading to the subsequent proteasomal degradation of N-Cor complex, thereby allowing cofactor exchange, and transcription activation; Belongs to the WD repeat EBI family"
58,MCL,1,Red,61,TET2,9606.ENSP00000442788,"Methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2; Dioxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of the modified genomic base 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5- hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and plays a key role in active DNA demethylation. Has a preference for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in CpG motifs. Also mediates subsequent conversion of 5hmC into 5- formylcytosine (5fC), and conversion of 5fC to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Conversion of 5mC into 5hmC, 5fC and 5caC probably constitutes the first step in cytosine demethylation. Methylation at the C5 position of cytosine bases is an epigenetic modification of the m [...] "
